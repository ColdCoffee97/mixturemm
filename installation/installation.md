# Installation

!!! warning "Dependencies"

    Be aware that not all dependencies of the package are available on pip. It is therefore recommended to install it into a anaconda environment with [OpenMM](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/openmm), [packmol](https://anaconda.org/omnia/packmol), [MDAnalysis](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mdanalysis), [mdtraj](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/mdtraj), [seaborn](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/seaborn), [more-itertools](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/more-itertools) and [tidynamics](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/tidynamics). Alternatively, you can use this [txt-file](https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/mixturemm/blob/main/mixturemm_req.txt) to create an environment with all dependencies on Windows.

## Stable release

To install mixturemm, run this command in your terminal:

``` 
pip install mixturemm
```

!!! warning 

    The release is currently under construction, until it is available please use the git clone method.

This is the preferred method to install mixturemm, as it will always install the most recent stable release.
